                The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Discord server.
                There are thousands of other developers in there,
                so it's a great place to ask questions. Frontend Mentor even have a dedicated "help" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our Discord server here.            </p>
